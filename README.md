# GETTING STARTED #
The GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/aharwood2/LUMA/wiki) provides all the latest information on building LUMA for different platforms.    

## OUR DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ##
To start working on a feature:  

1) Clone the repo.  
2) Create a local branch and name it after the issue on the tracker (e.g. Issue18).  
3) Work on the issue updating the issue tracker with comments to keep everyone informed of progress.  
4) Commit often and remember to update the releases notes in the *./docs/* directory describing the changes in as much detail as possible. Use existing formatting as a guide.  
5) Push the changes to a remote version of the repo for all to see.  
6) Mark the issue as resolved.  
7) Register a pull request into the pre-release branch so our development team can discuss the changes and run tests before merging.    
8) Once merged, we will mark the issue as closed.
9) Wiki release notes are updated from the release notes in the *./docs/* notes by the development team when a release is pushed to the master.

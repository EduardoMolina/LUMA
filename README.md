## BEFORE YOU BEGIN ##
To start working on a feature:  

1) Clone the repo.  
2) Create a local branch and name it after the issue on the tracker (e.g. Issue18).  
3) Work on the issue updating the issue tracker with comments to keep everyone informed of progress.  
4) Commit often and remember to update the releases notes in the *./docs/* directory describing the changes in as much detail as possible. Use existing formatting as a guide.  
5) Push the changes to a remote version of the repo for all to see.  
6) Mark the issue as resolved.  
7) Register a pull request so we can discuss the changes before merging into the master branch.  
8) Revise or merge as a group into the pre-release branch.  
9) Mark the issue as closed.    

## BUILDING THE SOFTWARE ##
The GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/aharwood2/LUMA/wiki) is now the best place to get the latest information on building LUMA. All relevant information that was available internally has now been transferred to the wiki documentation as the project is now open source.

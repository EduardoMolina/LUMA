To start working on a feature:

1) Clone the repo
2) Create a local branch and name it after the issue on the tracker (e.g. Issue18)
3) Work on the issue updating the issue tracker with comments to keep everyone informed of progress
4) When ready make a commit on your local branch describing the changes in as much detail as possible
5) Push the changes to a remote version of the repo for all to see
6) Mark the issue as resolved
7) Register a pull request so we can discuss the changes before merging into the master branch
8) Revise or merge as a group into the master
9) Mark the issue as closed.

Any questions feel free to contact me, Adrian.
